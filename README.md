🎨 Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Welcome to my Data Visualization Practice Repository!
This repo contains my exercises, examples, and mini-projects focused on mastering Matplotlib and Seaborn — two of Python’s most powerful libraries for creating insightful and visually appealing data visualizations.
🔍 What's Inside
📊 Matplotlib Basics: Line, bar, scatter, histogram, and pie charts
🧩 Advanced Matplotlib: Subplots, styling, annotations, and custom themes
🌈 Seaborn Visualizations: Heatmaps, pair plots, violin plots, and categorical plots
🧠 Data Insights: Visual storytelling through patterns, correlations, and distributions
🖼️ Projects: Real-world datasets turned into meaningful, well-designed visual narratives
🚀 Purpose
This repository showcases my learning journey in data visualization — turning raw data into clear and compelling visuals.
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of aesthetic design principles, chart interpretation, and data communication using Python.
